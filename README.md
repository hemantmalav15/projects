# project-4 (The Dice Game) 
This game shows two dice images on the screen that represents two players,
when we refresh the page our code generates two random numbers and displays that number on the dice images,
if RandomNumber1 is greater than the RandomNumber2 then we shows a message (player1 wins),
if RandomNumber2 is greater than the RandomNumber1 then we shows a message (player2 wins), 
if both generated random numbers are same we show a ("draw") message.
